What does the 'S' in SOLID stand for?,,Single System|Structured Responsibility|Single Responsibility|Systematic Refactoring,2,"The 'S' stands for Single Responsibility Principle. This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change.",EASY,SRP,Design Principles,Core
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states a class should have only one:,,Reason to change|Method|Interface|Dependency,0,"SRP is defined by the idea that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it has only one job or responsibility.",EASY,SRP,Design Principles
Which design pattern is often used to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)?,,Singleton Pattern|Factory Pattern|Strategy Pattern|Decorator Pattern,2,"The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, fulfilling the 'open for extension' part of OCP.",MEDIUM,OCP,Design Principles,Pattern
Open for extension, closed for modification"" defines which SOLID principle?,Single Responsibility Principle|Liskov Substitution Principle|Open/Closed Principle|Interface Segregation Principle,2,"The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.",EASY,OCP,Design Principles
Violating the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) often leads to:,,God Objects|Unnecessary type checking ('instanceof')|Tight Coupling|Increased boilerplate code,1,"Violating LSP often forces the client code to check the actual type of the object (using 'instanceof') to see if it can safely call a method, which is a code smell.",MEDIUM,LSP,Design Principles,Bad Practice
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ensures that subtypes are _________ for their base types.,,Interchangeable|Composable|Final|Static,0,"LSP dictates that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.",EASY,LSP,Design Principles
What is the primary benefit of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)?,,Reduces the number of classes|Prevents large 'fat' interfaces|Enforces one method per interface|Promotes loose coupling between layers,1,"ISP aims to keep interfaces small and client-specific, avoiding 'fat' interfaces that force implementors to depend on methods they don't use.",EASY,ISP,Design Principles
A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use"" is the core idea of:,,Open/Closed Principle|Dependency Inversion Principle|Interface Segregation Principle|Single Responsibility Principle,2,"This is the definition of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), promoting smaller, role-specific interfaces.",EASY,ISP,Design Principles
In Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), high-level modules should depend on _________.,Low-level modules|Concrete implementations|Abstractions|Utility classes,2,"DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).",EASY,DIP,Design Principles
Which SOLID principle promotes the use of Dependency Injection (DI)?,,SRP|OCP|LSP|DIP,3,"Dependency Injection is a common technique used to implement the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) by injecting dependencies as abstractions.",EASY,DIP,Design Principles,DI
A class that handles both data validation and database persistence violates which principle?,,Open/Closed Principle|Liskov Substitution Principle|Single Responsibility Principle|Dependency Inversion Principle,2,"The class has two distinct 'reasons to change': one for validation logic and one for persistence logic, violating SRP.",MEDIUM,SRP,Design Principles,Violation
The relationship where high-level modules depend on abstractions and low-level modules also depend on those abstractions is defined by:,"",Open/Closed Principle|Liskov Substitution Principle|Interface Segregation Principle|Dependency Inversion Principle,3,"DIP reverses the traditional dependency flow: both high-level (business logic) and low-level (implementation details) depend on an abstraction.",MEDIUM,DIP,Design Principles
The Open/Closed Principle is typically achieved through:,,Inheritance and Polymorphism|Private methods and Final classes|Static methods and Utility classes|Direct class instantiation,0,"By programming to an interface or abstract class (polymorphism), you can swap in new implementations (extension) without changing the existing client code (closed for modification).",MEDIUM,OCP,Design Principles
Which principle states that subclasses should be able to seamlessly replace their base classes?,,SRP|OCP|LSP|ISP,2,"LSP is all about type substitutability, ensuring that a subtype can be used wherever its supertype is expected.",EASY,LSP,Design Principles
Which principle is most closely associated with reducing the impact of changes in one part of the system on another (Decoupling)?,,SRP|OCP|DIP|ISP,2,"DIP is the primary principle for decoupling, ensuring that high-level logic is shielded from changes in low-level implementation details through abstraction.",MEDIUM,DIP,Design Principles,Decoupling
